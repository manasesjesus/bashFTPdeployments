# Bash Script for SFTP deployments

Believe it or not, there are still projects where the only way to make a deployment is using FTP/SFTP, so those nice SSH commands/scripts to have an automated deployment and CI/CD practices won't work. Furthermore, to drag & drop using tools such as Filezilla can be tedious when there are all kind of files in different directories. That's why I wrote this bash script to have a semi-automated deployment process.
